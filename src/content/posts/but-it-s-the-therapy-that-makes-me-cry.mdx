This is a part 3 of my back-now-know-as-leg pain, here's part 2: \[Sticks and stones breaks my bones]\([https://davidspace.vercel.app/blogs/article/sticks-and-stones-breaks-my-bones](https://davidspace.vercel.app/blogs/article/sticks-and-stones-breaks-my-bones))

So a lot has happened. I got into physical therapy and I got diagnosed with shortened leg muscles, basically the leg muscles can contract but it's very hard for them to expand to the fullest.

Guess why, it's for spending years programing without working out. No, even if I worked out it would have happened still.

So the the therapy consist in massaging the muscle and slowly stretching it so it regains the ability to fully expand as any muscle should. And goddamn it hurts like a \*\*MF\*\*.

But it works, I've been feeling way better and things where looking awesome.

\## Until it stopped

One day it started to rain and the house was badly prepared for it, \*It doesn't rain a lot here, we usually spend months from rain to rain and even then it's a light rain\*.&#x20;

So the water canals were clogged, well, more like it was enough for the usual light rain, not for this. And it resulted in the house flooding really fast.

At the time, only my grandparents where doing anything, my grandpa unclogging the drain and grandma pushing the water out.

Now, in case you forgot, I cannot lift weights, but I said.

\> I ain't gonna let my grandma push the water alone.

\> Imma over extend and help out

Wich resulted in me loosing progress and being unable to walk for a week straight.

Today I still can't walk properly, \*\*I've really fucked up\*\*, and now I've spend more time undoing the damage instead of recovering the previous one.

I don't really regret it but goddamn I can barely sleep with this pain, I can barely walk and sure as hell I can't even work in any way, not even in my hobbies.

So, I hope this pain goes away for good.
