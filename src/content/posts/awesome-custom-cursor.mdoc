# Awesome Custom Cursor

[Github Link](https://github.com/DaviD4Chirino/awesome-custom-cursor)

I made this Godot 4.x addon to facilitate custom cursors in my games _(notice how I have more addons than games)_ and it turned better than expected.

Initially, I was just making an AnimatedSprite2D follow the mouse around, however, the drawback is that theres always a frame of delay. You can mitigate that with higher frame rates but if you're banking on the user having a top tier computer, I wont like you very much. _(specially because i am the lower end of users)_

Initially, i wanted to have custom shapes, like I wanted the cursor to turn into a crosshair when theres something to shoot at, or a heart when theres a health pickup, or an eye when theres something of interest, things like that. And in fact, that was version 1.x of my Addon _you can get version 1 in the releases of the project_.

In summary, you make an animation with your frames matching the name of the shape like:

1. pointer
2. busy
3. can_drop

And i look at the current shape and play the animation with the same name _(with a bit of parsing on my end)_. And thats it, you have an animation of a cursor stuck to your real cursor.

However i realized we use at most 5 cursor shapes, those being:

- Pointer
- Drag
- I-Beam _(the one you have right now when hovering over this text)_
- Help _(the one with the question mark)_
- Busy

And Godot has 17 of them, and I got really fed up with the 1-frame delay. So instead of making a image following the mouse, so i made a "native" one with is version 2.x and the one you are seeing.

Now, Godot does not have animated cursors, its just static images so what I took the animation system of v1.x and made is so on every shape change you play an invisible animation, and i project the current animation image into the mouse. In other words **We force the engine to be animated by changing the frames manually.**

There's still the drawback of only having 17 shapes, if you're making an app or just want more shapes, tough luck, but i still have v1.x available if you're in the need of more shapes.

You can get these versions:
