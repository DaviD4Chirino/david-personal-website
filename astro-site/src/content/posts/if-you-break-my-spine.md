# I can't stand when you break my spine

Years ago, I worked on a website for a client that I did not finished because I was new and could not deliver in time, _I got my current pc from the partial pay so it wasn't too bad_.

_No problem! I'll get another job eazy peazy_ - Me, an absolute buffoon.

The work did not come and it left me with years of unemployment and a pain the back. _"it's from sitting to too much"_ me again, _"when I start working out it should fix itself"_.

Now I got another job at a printer place, here we call them cybers because we work mainly with computers and printers.

So on the first day of being trialed, I got to stand for 8+ hours and o was simply not prepared. So the pain I was ignoring came back full force and now I can't stand for more than 30 minutes or else I fell like **something will break**.

I also work in a family fast food local that has 2 years of being open, me working on it for the past 1 and half years.

With the pain and now treatment I am bed ridden of minimum 10 days. I lost the cyber job and I need to make the fast food job work to pay for my medicine.

I got nothing to show except of rambling about [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and FOSS programs.

Wich means I almost never gonna get another job like that again, so I'm really salty about it.

I was also working on moving this site to nextjs so I can generate RSS feeds for you guys, but that will have to wait.

I hope this back pain disappears for good.
